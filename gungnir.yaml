# capabilityCheck provides the details needed for checking an incoming JWT's
# capabilities.  If the type of check isn't provided, no checking is done.  The 
# type can be "monitor" or "enforce".  If it is empty or a different value, no 
# checking is done.  If "monitor" is provided, the capabilities are checked but 
# the request isn't rejected when there isn't a valid capability for the 
# request. Instead, a message is logged.  When "enforce" is provided, a request 
# that doesn't have the needed capability is rejected.
#
# The capability is expected to have the format:
#
# {prefix}{endpoint}:{method}
#
# The prefix can be a regular expression.  If it's empty, no capability check 
# is done.  The endpoint is a regular expression that should match the endpoint
# the request was sent to. The method is usually the method of the request, such as 
# GET.  The accept all method is a catchall string that indicates the capability 
# is approved for all methods.
# (Optional)
# capabilityCheck:
#   type: "enforce"
#   prefix: "prefix Here"
